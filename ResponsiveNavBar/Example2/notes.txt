HTML
- everthing wrapped in a nav* tag
- two basic components
    1. company name*
        basic div
    2. titles of the other pages on website
        div* with a unordered list and its items
- one thing to ignore
    1. the 3 bars that makeup the menu symbol
        they're actual tags not images
            3 spans* wrapped in an anchor tag*

CSS 
- basic essentials for everything 
- navbar is flex spaced btw
- ul is flex row
- get rid of the list items dots
- style for the page titles
- style the mobile look of the page titles with no display 
- style the three menu bars 

    media query anything less 400px
- show the menu now
- naturally hide the contents of the menu
- but when it is displayed define the flex as columns
- define the contents of the navbar
- flex direction when active


JS
- variable for the toggle-button class
    which returns an array
- and the same thing for navbar-links class
- add an event listener to the toggle button 
    which will listen for a click
        when clicked or active we want to toggle the classList from the navBarLinks
            if the active class exists 
                it will add it 
            if the active class does exist 
                it gets rid of it 
aka
    open and close the navbar
