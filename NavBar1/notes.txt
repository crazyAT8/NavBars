Guy shows you how to make the same navbar 3 different ways
1. 3 even
    Logo - list items - contact button
        all spaced evenly at the top of the page
            flex with a justify content space around
2. 2 even 
    Logo ------------- list-items contact button 
        same thing as above, but wrap the list-items and button in a span
            make the span flex, space- between 
3. 2 even in reverse
    list-items contact button ------------- Logo
        same exact thing but the flex in the head 
            add flex-direction: row reverse
